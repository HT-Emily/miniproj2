    He first attracted Hollywood's attention with his award-winning short film Titsiana Booberini written by Tania Lacy. After screening to much acclaim at several festivals within Australia, Titsiana Booberini became a hit at many internationally renowned festivals including the Sundance Film Festival.[3] It won "Best Film" at the Aspen Shortsfest.[4]

    Luketic directed the comedy Legally Blonde for MGM in the summer of 2001. This film, which grossed close to $100 million domestically and was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, marked Luketic's feature film directing debut.</p>
