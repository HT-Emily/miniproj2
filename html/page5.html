<h1> Monster-in-Law </h1>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d5/Monster-in-Law_poster.JPG" style="float:left;padding-right:12px" width="280" />Monster-in-Law is a 2005 romantic comedy film directed by Robert Luketic, written by Anya Kochoff and starring Jane Fonda, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Vartan and Wanda Sykes. It marked a return to cinema for Fonda, being her first film since Stanley & Iris in 1990. The film was negatively received by critics who praised Fonda's performance but panned the screenplay, and Lopez's performance. Monster-in-Law was a box office success, grossing $154 million on a $43 million budget.</p>
